# Subscription Tracker

This is a simple rails application for managing and tracking your personal subscriptions.  It's a really simple/lightweight application that probably doesn't offer much over a simple spreadsheet but it was a nice sandbox for me to experiment with Rails 7 & Hotwired.

Right now this really only works well inside a devcontainer (for which there is a configuration provided).  I will hopefully get this working as a self-hostable docker container soon.
